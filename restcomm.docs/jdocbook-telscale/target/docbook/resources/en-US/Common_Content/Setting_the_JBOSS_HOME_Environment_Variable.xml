		(

		The best way to know for sure whether

		The

			Platform
		</application>
		and most &PLATFORM_NAME;
		servers are built on top of the
		<application>JBoss Application Server</application>
		(
		<application>JBoss AS</application>
		). When the
		<application>&PLATFORM_NAME;
			Platform
		</application>
		or &PLATFORM_NAME;
		servers are built
		<emphasis>from source</emphasis>
		, then
		<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>
		<emphasis>must</emphasis>
		be set, because the &PLATFORM_NAME;
		files are installed into (or
		<quote>over top of</quote>
		if you prefer) a clean
		<application>JBoss AS</application>
		installation, and the build process assumes that the location pointed
		to by the
		<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>
		environment variable at the time of building is the
		<application>JBoss AS</application>
		installation into which you want it to install the &PLATFORM_NAME;
		files.
	</para>
	<para>
		This guide does not detail building the
		<application>&PLATFORM_NAME;
			Platform
		</application>
		or any &PLATFORM_NAME;
		servers from source. It is nevertheless useful to understand the role
		played by
		<application>JBoss AS</application>
		and
		<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>
		in the &PLATFORM_NAME;
		ecosystem.

		The immediately-following section considers whether you need to set
		<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>

			Even if you fall into the category below of

			to set
			<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>
			, it is good practice nonetheless to check and make sure that
			<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>
			actually

			set or defined on your system for some reason. This can save you both

		Setting

		in your personal
		<filename>~/.bashrc</filename>
		startup script carries the advantage of retaining effect over reboots.
		Each time you log in, the environment variable is sure to be set for
		you, as a user. On Unix, it is possible to set
		<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>
		as a system-wide environment variable, by defining it in
		<filename>/etc/bashrc</filename>
		, but this method is neither recommended nor detailed in these
		instructions.

	<procedure>
		<title>To Set JBOSS_HOME on Unix...</title>
		<step>
			<para>
				Open the
				<filename>~/.bashrc</filename>
				startup script, which is a hidden file in your home directory, in a
				text editor, and insert the following line on its own line while
				substituting for the actual install location on your system:
			</para>
			<!-- export JBOSS_HOME="/home/<replaceable>&lt;username&gt;</replaceable>/<replaceable>&lt;path&gt;</replaceable>/<replaceable>&lt;to&gt;</replaceable>/<replaceable>&lt;install_directory&gt;</replaceable>" -->
			<screen>export JBOSS_HOME="/home/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/&lt;install_directory&gt;"</screen>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Save and close the
				<filename>.bashrc</filename>
				startup script.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				You should
				<command>source</command>
				the
				<filename>.bashrc</filename>
				script to force your change to take effect, so that
				<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>
				becomes set for the current session
				<footnote>
					<para>
						Note that any other terminals which were opened prior to your
						having altered
						<filename>.bashrc</filename>
						will need to

						<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>

				</footnote>
				.
			</para>
			<!-- ~]$ source ~/.bashrc -->
			<screen>~]$ source ~/.bashrc</screen>
		</step>
		<step>

				Finally, ensure that
				<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>
				is set in the current session, and actually points to the correct
				location:

					<application>&PLATFORM_NAME;
					</application>
					servers (with
					<application>JBoss AS</application>
					bundled!), then
					<envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>
					would point to the
