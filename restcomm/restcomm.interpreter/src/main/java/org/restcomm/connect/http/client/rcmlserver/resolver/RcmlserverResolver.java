/**
 * A relative URI resolver for Rcmlserver/RVD. It values defined in rcmlserver restcomm.xml configuration
 * section (rcmlserver.base-url, rcmlserver.api-path) to convert relative urls to absolute i.e. prepent Rcmlserver origin (http://rcmlserver.domain:port).
 * By design, the resolver is used when resolving Application.rcmlUrl only. An additional filter prefix
 * is used and helps the resolver affect only urls that start with "/restcomm-rvd/". This filter value is
 * configurable through rcmlserver.api-path. It will use whatever it between the first pair of slashes "/.../".
 * If configuration is missing or rcmlserver is deployed bundled with restcomm the resolver won't affect the
 * uri resolved, typically leaving UriUtils class take care of it.
