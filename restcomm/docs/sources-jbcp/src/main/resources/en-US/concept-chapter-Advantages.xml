	<title>Advantages of the RestComm</title>
	<para>Loose coupling and reusability of SIP Components across different
		applications are the most obvious advantages over the current SIP
		Servlets 1.1 specification. In addition to that, you get better
		integration with Java EE 6.</para>
	<para>
		In the future we will try to explore further usage of this
		component-based approach to allow application developers to compose
		their applications in a new way and benefits from Modularization
		within a single application which should give additional performance
		improvements over SIP Servlets Application Routing and Chaining while
		you can still use the latter.
