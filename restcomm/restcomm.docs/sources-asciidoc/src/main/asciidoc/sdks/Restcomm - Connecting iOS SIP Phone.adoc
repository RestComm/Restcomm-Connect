Integrating any iOS SIP client or SIP SDK with Telscale Restcomm for voice and messaging is intuitive. In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure an iPhone/iPod/iPad and make calls using Restcomm. 

= Requirements for iOS SIP Client

* You must install any SIP capable client from the Apple store of your iPhone. In the example below we shall be using link:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sessiontalk-sip-voip-softphone/id357429372[SessionTalk]
* Make sure Telscale Restcomm is running on an Amazon AMI or another server that can be accessed from the phone. Please see <<Starting Restcomm-Connect.adoc#start-restcomm-connect,Starting Restcomm-Connect>> to lean more about how to work with Restcomm.
* You will need at least one iOS based phone or tablet. In this document we will test with two iPhones. If you do not have two iOS based devices, the second one can be any SIP client running on your computer or another mobile device.

= Scenario

* Create 2 Restcomm clients Alice and Bob using Restcomm admin UI.
* You will configure the first android phone to register as Alice and the Second to register as Bob.
* You will make a call from Alice to Bob.
* You may also choose to dial any SIP clients that is reachable through a public IP address.
