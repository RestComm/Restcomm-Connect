= Restcomm API – Incoming Phone Numbers

[[IncomingPhoneNumbers]]
== IncomingPhoneNumbers

An IncomingPhoneNumber instance resource represents a Restcomm phone number

The IncomingPhoneNumbers list resource represents an account's Restcomm phone numbers. You can POST to the list resource to provision a new Restcomm number. To find a new number to provision use the subresources of the AvailablePhoneNumbers resource.

You can move phone numbers between two Restcomm accounts if you're using subaccounts. For details, see Exchanging Numbers Between Subaccounts.

Provisioning a phone number is a two-step process. First, you must find an available phone number to provision using the subresources of the AvailablePhoneNumbers resource. Second, you must POST to the IncomingPhoneNumbers list resource, documented below.

With IncomingPhoneNumber **statusCallback**, you can subscribe to receive webhooks for different events on the incoming phone number.

The statusCallback events are:

The *statusCallbackMethod* attribute allows you to specify which HTTP method Restcomm should use when requesting the URL in the statusCallback attribute. The default is POST.

==== Status Callback HTTP Parameters

The parameters Restcomm passes to your application in its asynchronous request to the StatusCallback URL include all parameters passed in a synchronous request to retrieve RCML when Restcomm receives a call to one of your Restcomm numbers. The full list of parameters and descriptions of each are in the RCML Voice Request documentation.

When the call progress events are fired, the Status Callback request also passes these additional parameters:
