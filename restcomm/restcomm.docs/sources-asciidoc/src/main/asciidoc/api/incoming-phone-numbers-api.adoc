= Restcomm API – Incoming Phone Numbers

[[IncomingPhoneNumbers]]
== IncomingPhoneNumbers

An IncomingPhoneNumber instance resource represents a Restcomm phone number

The IncomingPhoneNumbers list resource represents an account's Restcomm phone numbers. You can POST to the list resource to provision a new Restcomm number. To find a new number to provision use the subresources of the AvailablePhoneNumbers resource.

You can move phone numbers between two Restcomm accounts if you're using subaccounts. For details, see Exchanging Numbers Between Subaccounts.

Provisioning a phone number is a two-step process. First, you must find an available phone number to provision using the subresources of the AvailablePhoneNumbers resource. Second, you must POST to the IncomingPhoneNumbers list resource, documented below.
