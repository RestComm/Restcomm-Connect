= Restcomm DNS Provisioning Provider Integration

Restcomm provides functionality to integrate with DNS hosting providers, this way you can create new organizations in restcomm on custom domains.

Following configuration need to be provided in order to enable DNS provisioning when creating organizations

[source,shell]
----
DNS_PROVISIONING_ENABLED="TRUE"
DNS_PROVISIONING_CLASS=""
----

**DNS_PROVISIONING_ENABLED**: By default dns provisioning is disabled which means during organization api CRUD operations, restcomm will not send any requests to DNS hosting server. If we set it to true we have to provide following configurations.
**DNS_PROVISIONING_CLASS**: It represents the DNS provisioning manager class, the class that calls DNS hosting provider's services to perform CRUD operations. Developers can provide customer Class for any DNS server as long as it implements `org.restcomm.connect.dns.DnsProvisioningManager`

DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_A_VALUE=""
DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_SRV_VALUE=""
DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_ACCESS_KEY=""
DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_SECRET_KEY=""
DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_REGION=""
DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_TTL=""
DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_HOSTED_ZONE_ID=""
DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_IS_ALIAS=""
DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_ALIAS_EVALUATE_TARGET_HEALTH=""
DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_ALIAS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID=""
----

**DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_A_VALUE**: is address to which DNS Server will route traffic In a cluster, it can be public ip of loadbalancer or alias/domainName of a DNS entity (AWS ELB etc).
**DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_SRV_VALUE**: SRV destination server value (e.g sip.restcomm.com)
**DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_ACCESS_KEY**: aws access key to call their APIs.
**DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_SECRET_KEY**: aws secret key to call their APIs.
**DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_REGION**: The region to be used by the client. This will be used to determine both the ervice endpoint (eg: https://sns.us-west-1.amazonaws.com) and signing region (eg: us-west-1) for requests.
**DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_TTL**: Time to live in seconds, default is 3600 seconds
**DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_HOSTED_ZONE_ID**: The ID of the hosted zone that contains the resource record sets that you want to change. For example hosted zone id of domain `restcomm.com`, this can be get from aws management console.

[NOTE]
====
If DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_A_VALUE is an alias and DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_IS_ALIAS is set to true: we need to provide further configuration for
====

**DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_ALIAS_EVALUATE_TARGET_HEALTH**: Boolean to either evaluate target health or not, default is false.
**DNS_PROVISIONING_AWS_ROUTE53_ALIAS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID**: The ID of the hosted zone of the alias.
